# zoo-toy-models
Having fun with toy models for free-fermionic topological systems. Codes are written in Python and the functions for real-space models use QuSpin library (http://weinbe58.github.io/QuSpin/), so one may easy leverage the functionality to the many-body physics problems.

# What's here?
Basic models and plotting scripts.

```python
ssh
```
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in real and reciprocal spaces.
